        <h1>UQ Havard Reference</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>About UQ Havard Refence</h3>
        <p>The “Harvard style” is not an actual style, it is not associated with Harvard University - see their statement.  There is no official manual for the "Harvard style" but it has historically been associated with the author-date style. There are many variants which follow the author-date convention, including the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Chicago Manual of Style.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>In-text citations</h3>
        <p>&bull; In an author-date style, in-text citations usually require the name of the author(s) and the year of publication in parentheses; e.g. (Jones 2017)</p>
        <p>&bull; If the author's name is included within the sentence, only the date (and page reference if appropriate) is included in parentheses and it is best placed directly after the author's name. e.g. Taylor (2015) purports that ...</p>
        <p>&bull; A page number is included if you have a direct quote, paraphrase a passage or you want to direct the reader to a specific page or pages. </p>
        <p>&bull; When including a page number, place a comma after the year and use the abbreviations p. (for a single page reference) and pp. (for multiple pages); e.g. (Smith 2016, p. 105) or (Harris 2013, pp. 131-132)   </p>
        <p>&bull; Place the in-text citation at the end of a sentence, before the concluding punctuation; e.g. ... 'anxiety about the cultural effects of globalisation' (Smith 2016, p. 105). Or, if the citation refers to only part of a sentence, place it at the end of the clause or phrase to which it relates; e.g. This was not the case prior to 1974 (James 2001), however  ....  </p>
        <p>&bull; If there is no date provided for a source, the abbreviation n.d. may be used; e.g. (Jones n.d.) or (Brown n.d., pp. 49-50)</p>
        <p>&bull; Separate multiple citations by a semi-colon; e.g. (Brown n.d., pp. 49-50; Smith 2016, p. 105)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Direct quotation</h3>
        <p>&bull; A direct quotation reproduces word-for-word material directly quoted from another author’s work, or from your own previously-published work.</p>
